3. Choose the best data type for each of the following, so that no memory storage is wasted. Give an example of a typical value that would be held by the variable and explain why you chose the type you did. (2.1, 2.3)

a) the number of years of school you have completed 

ANSWER: An ideal data type would be a Unsigned byte or "byte."  It can cover the minimum and maximum number of years in school.
Typical Value: From 0 to 255.

b) your final grade in this class 

ANSWER: An ideal data type would be a Char. Grades are given out with a letter grade like, 
"A, B, C, D, F." 
Typical Value: 1 byte.

c) the population of China 

ANSWER: An ideal type would be a Signed integer or a "int." It is large enough hold a value more than 2 billion. China's population in 2022 is 1.412 billion. Population number of a country is never a number with a decimal. 
Typical Value: From -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647.

d) the number of passengers on an airline flight 

ANSWER: An ideal data type would be a Unsigned byte or "byte." The average number of passengers on a scheduled flight is 160 seats. However, it can be less or more.
Typical Value: From 0 to 255.

e) one player’s score in a Scrabble game 

ANSWER: An ideal data type would be Signed short or "short." The highest score score was 830 by Michael Cresta. A short can hold a score up to 32,767. 
Typical Range: From −32,768 to 32,767

f) the number of Electoral College votes received by a U.S. presidential candidate 

ANSWER: An ideal data type would be Signed short or "short." The Electoral College consists of a total of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect. 
Typical Range: From −32,768 to 32,767

g) the number of days with below-freezing temperatures in a winter in Miami, Florida 

ANSWER: An ideal data type would be a Unsigned byte or "byte." Florida rarely experiences freezing temperatures. 
Typical Value: From 0 to 255.


h) one team’s score in a Major League Baseball game

ANSWER: An ideal data type would be a Unsigned byte or "byte."  It can hold a score value up to 127 homeruns in a MLB game. 
Typical Range: From -128 to 127.

5. Write a C# program named InchesToCentimeters that declares a named constant that holds the number of centimeters in an inch: 2.54. Also declare a variable to represent a measurement in inches, and assign a value. Display the measurement in both inches and centimeters—for example, 3 inches is 7.62 centimeters. (2.5, 2.10)

using System;

namespace InchesToCentimeters
{
    internal class InchesToCentimeters
    {
        public static int centInInch;

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            const double  
            CENT_IN_INCH = 2.54;
            int inches;
            inches = 1;
            Console.WriteLine(inches + " inches" + " is " + CENT_IN_INCH + " centimeters ", "InchesToCentimeters");
        }
    }
}

=========================================================

7. Write a C# program named ProjectedRaises that includes a named constant representing next year’s anticipated 4 percent raise for each employee in a company. Also declare variables to represent the current salaries for three employees. Assign values to the variables, and display, with explanatory text, next year’s salary for each employee. (2.5, 2.10)

using System;

namespace ProjectedRaises
{
    internal class ProjectedRaises
    {
        public static int EMPLOY_WITH_RAISES;

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //expected 4% salary raise
            const double EMPLOY_WITH_RAISES = 0.04;
           
            //current employee salaries
            int Sarah;
            Sarah = 45811;
            int Elizabeth;
            Elizabeth = 56739;
            int Xavier;
            Xavier = 95831;

            Console.WriteLine("The company has decided to increase next year salaries of Sarah, Elizabeth, and Xavier by 4%");
            Console.WriteLine();

            //this will display out a line that shows the salary with the 4% raise
            Console.WriteLine("Next year, Sarah's salary will be $" + ((Sarah * EMPLOY_WITH_RAISES) + Sarah) + ".");
            Console.WriteLine();

            //this will display out a line that shows the salary with the 4% raise
            Console.WriteLine("Next year, Elizabeth's salary will be $" + ((Elizabeth * EMPLOY_WITH_RAISES) + Elizabeth) + ".");
            Console.WriteLine();

            //this will display out a line that shows the salary with the 4% raise
            Console.WriteLine("Next year, Xavier's salary will be $" + ((Xavier * EMPLOY_WITH_RAISES) + Xavier) + ".");
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}

=========================================================

10. Write a program named HoursAndMinutes that declares a variable to represent minutes worked on a job. Assign a value to the variable. Display the value in hours and minutes. For example, 197 minutes becomes 3 hours and 17 minutes. (2.5, 2.10, 2.11)

using System;

namespace HoursAndMinutes
{
    public class HoursAndMinutes
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Console.Write("Enter Minutes here: ");
            int minutes = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

            int hours = minutes / 60;
            int remainingMinutes = minutes % 60;

            Console.WriteLine(minutes + " minutes is " + hours + " hours and " + remainingMinutes + " minutes.");
        }
    }
}

=========================================================

11. Write a program named Eggs that declares four variables to hold the number of eggs produced in a month by each of four chickens. Assign a value to each variable. Sum the eggs, then display the total in dozens and eggs. For example, a total of 127 eggs is 10 dozen and 7 eggs. (2.5, 2.10, 2.11)

using System;

namespace Eggs
{
    public class Eggs
    {
        private static int totalEggs;

        static void Main()
        {
            int chickenone;
            chickenone = 21;
            int chickentwo;
            chickentwo = 22;
            int chickenthree;
            chickenthree = 23;
            int chickenfour;
            chickenfour = 24;

            totalEggs = chickenone + chickentwo + chickenthree + chickenfour;

            int dozen = totalEggs / 12;

            int remainingEggs = totalEggs % 12;

            Console.WriteLine("A total of " + (chickenone + chickentwo + chickenthree + chickenfour) + " eggs is about " + dozen + " dozen and " + remainingEggs + " eggs");
        }
    }
}
